Sarah Mustafa - Project Pitch

I have always seen people struggle with new technology so I decided to make an app that helps them find simple step-by-step solutions to their technology problems.
## Background
while many websites help with finding solutions for ios/android devices none of them are simple to use. Especially for the older generations.

## MVP


- As a user, I want to be able to register and log in.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a Technical problem.
- As a user, I want to be able to add solutions 
- As a user, I want to choose my device type
- As a user, I want to add solutions if it is not found
